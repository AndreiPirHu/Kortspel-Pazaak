# Card Game Pazaak

Pazaak is a card game from the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic that the player can play against some NPC:s throughout the game. 
This app is a 2-person versus mode of the card game where you can play against someone else on the same phone. 




## Game Rules

The purpose of the game is for a player to try to get to 20 or as close to 20 in total board value as possible and not go over that value.
If a player goes over 20 they instantly lose the round. Whenever both players end their turn, a new random card with a value from 1-10 gets added to both their boards

 Players can at any point in time decide to "stand" if they are satisfied with the value on their own board.

The game then waits for the other player to either "stand", win with a higher board value, or lose with a value over 20.

To their disposal, each player has 3 extra cards that they get to choose before the game starts. These cards have a value that can range from -4 to +5. 

The three cards that each player chooses can each be used only once during a playthrough and can help the players win a round.

The first player that wins 3 rounds first wins the game.
